      <p>
     
Human beings first emerged on Earth at least two hundred thousand years ago. The earliest group of humans originated in Africa and eventually began to migrate into the Middle East and across Asia and Europe. Life was brutal. Death rates as a result of disease and misfortune were very high, and life expectancies were low. An ice age lowered the sea levels of the oceans and as result, a natural lan bridge linked Russia and Alaska, which allowed migration route into the Americas. During that time period, the human population on Earth was estimated not more than five million people. Since then the global population has grown more than seven billion people, about fourteen hundred times more than when Native Americans first came to the Americas. It is estimated that human population first reached one billion around 1804 CE. The early 1800s was a time of rapid industrial growth in Europe and the Americas. Cities and factories were booming. Agricultural science was developing as well, and farmers were able to dramatically increase their productivity to feed the growing numbers of people.

      PRESENT

      <p>
      Growing enough food for a burgeoning population is becoming increasingly difficult. Fewer researchers have commented on what resource consumption to produce that food is doing to the world’s environment. Moreover, there is a theoretical limit to the amount of food that can be produced. The world may very well reach a peak population before it finally begins to level off. Another major issue comes from the total amount of human waste produced at any given time. Humans consume oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide. Sewage is a major issue. In fact, many researchers have predicted that wars will soon be fought over access to clean drinking water and other basic necessities. Many systems of controlling the population have failed. However, it’s interesting to note that many wealthy nations have aging populations. Falling birthrates are actually a major problem in some of the world’s richest countries. While the population continues to boom in newly industrialized powers as well as the third world, nations that have had massive economies for a long time are aging rapidly. We’re seeing this in the U.S. right now. As smaller nations become wealthier, they are less likely to become overpopulated. People living in an industrialized society are less pressured to have large numbers of children. Moreover, the stress of having other obligations limits their amount of time to develop massive families.
